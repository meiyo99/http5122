		<h2>Functions</h2>
		<p id="par1">Functions let us create blocks of code to do one specific job for us, and will wait until we call them.  We can give functions values that they will need to do their job (parameters or arguments).  Functions may also return one value to us.</p>

		<h2>The Big 5 Concepts</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>A function is a block of code that waits until it is called by name to execute.</li>
			<li>Functions can have variables (called 'parameters') that can be used within the function</li>
			<li>Functions can return one value at the end of their logical operations.</li>
			<li>Functions can be used anywhere in our logic, and can be called from inside other functions.</li>
			<li>Variables declared inside a function cannot be “seen” outside of that function. Where a variable can be seen is referred to as its “scope”.</li>
		</ol>
